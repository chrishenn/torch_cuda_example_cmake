    This script will attempt to use cmake and make to build a library for each folder in project_dir/cuda_lib.
    The default behavior is to carry out 'dirty' builds, calling solely 'make' when possible.
    If the -c option is passed to this script, or a given build folder is not present, then it will attempt a 'clean' build.
    A clean build will delete and recreate any existing build folder if needed, and will call 'cmake ..', followed by 'make' in the new build folder.
    The number of true cores available according to nproc will be used to build via 'make -j n_cores'.
